			<h2><u>Obesity</u><em> is #2 worldwide cause of death</em></h2>
			<p> 		Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A body mass index (BMI) over 25 is considered overweight, and over 30 is obese. The issue has grown to epidemic proportions, with over 4 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese in 2017 according to the global burden of disease. </p>
			<p>Rates of overweight and obesity continue to grow in adults and children. From 1975 to 2016, the prevalence of obese children and adolescents aged 5â€“19 years increased from 4% to 18% globally.<br>
			The vast majority of overweight or obese children live in developing countries, where the rate of increase has been more than 30% higher than that of developed countries</p>
